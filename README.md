# citr0mods
> [!NOTE]
> The current version is v3.2

A modification to [end-4 dotfiles](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/) that modifies end-4 in a favorable way. The script fully handles modifying the hyprland configurations and adding entries to the keybinds screen.

## Features:
* Disable Mouse Acceleration
* Add keybinds to open commonly used apps in their own workspaces
* Disable sleep 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Yes, I know I used python for this. I am currently learning python and need the experience.

## Instalation:
Run apply.py to install. You must be on end-4 to sucessfully install.

> [!TIP]
> If you are not reinstalling, you will need to hit `y` for restarting!
