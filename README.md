# citr0mods
> [!NOTE]
> The current version is v3.3.4

A modification to [end-4 dotfiles](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/) that modifies end-4 in a favorable way. The script fully handles modifying the hyprland configurations and adding entries to the keybinds screen.

## Features:
* Disable Mouse Acceleration
* Add keybinds to open commonly used apps in their own workspaces (Spotify and Discord)
* Disable sleep 
* Add Floating Calculators

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When updating, you might experience an issue where on the keybinds file, there are repeating hastags (Like # # # # # bind). This issue is known and will not be resolved, as there is no point to.

## Instalation:
Run apply.py to install. You must be on end-4 to sucessfully install.

> [!TIP]
> If you are not reinstalling, you will need to hit `y` for restarting!

## Limitations
If you are reinstalling, you will need to remove the previous citr0mods entry in the custom keybinds configuration.

# citr0mods - Additions
> [!NOTE]
> Additions is currently in 0.0.1a
> * This will be under a __different__ structure than citr0mods as I need to explore new options

This is a realitivly new addition that is being worked on that you, the community, can request me to add new patches to the dot files.
This will be a seperate file due to the differences that this project has. It will be in this repository under [AdditionsInstaller.py](https://github.com/citr0net/citr0mods/blob/main/AdditionsInstaller.py)

Currently being worked on:
